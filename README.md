### FAQ

* Why is it taking so long to start up?

> Not any more! This was an issue that plagued versions of the Humble Trove Downloader prior to 1.5.0. The Humble Toolbox is lightning fast!

* Why is the installer so big?

> Chromium. It's chromium that does that

* It crashed! Help!

> File an issue [here](https://github.com/td512/Humble-Trove-Downloader/issues) and I'll take a look. If you've got the .NET stack trace, please include that in your report
